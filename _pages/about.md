I am a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor in the UCLA Department of Mathematics, working with Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/haydenschaeffer/" target="_blank">Hayden Schaeffer</a>. I was previously a graduate student in the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University, where I was co-advised by Professors <a href="https://cwrowley.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Clarence Rowley</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fefferman" target="_blank">Charles Fefferman</a>. You can find my CV <a href="https://github.com/sibirica/sibirica.github.io/blob/master/cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. 

I am primarily interested in developing more accurate and interpretable machine learning models for complex systems in the physical sciences and engineering, particularly physics and biology. My research projects tend to incorporate tools and insights from a wide range of other disciplines, such as theoretical computer science, operations research, and statistics. You can read more about my research <a href="https://sibirica.github.io/research">here</a>.
