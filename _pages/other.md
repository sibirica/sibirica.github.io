Hobbies

In a past life, I was an International Master and three-time US Scholastic Champion in chess. But I still play a bit every once in a while!

Since grad school, I've enjoyed a much wider array of board games. A couple of my favorites are [Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars) and [Blood on the Clocktower](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/240980/blood-on-the-clocktower) (a much more interesting take on the Mafia/Werewolf style of social deception games).

I'm a fan of all kinds of music, especially classical piano (and especially when I can find a place to [practice myself](/piano/).)

Finally, I love exploring LA whenever I get a chance.
